# What a week

Note: this is the [example file from the `README`](../README.md#example).

## 2024-02-12

Let's pretend this is what my day looked like:

* 07:30 - 09:00: ABC
* 09:00 - 10:00: DEF (let's pretend all project names are this simple)
* 10:00 - 12:30: ABC everything after the first word is treated as "notes"
  * I'm not sure yet what to do with "notes"
  * oh and sub-lists like this are currently ignored entirely
* 12:30 - 13:00: **ABC** extra _formatting_ is ignored
* unrelated top-level items are ignored too
* 14 - 16: GHI (minutes are optional)
* 16 17 GHI (as is most syntax)
* 1700 1730 "Some project" quoted project names like this will work at some point
  * or maybe I'll stop supporting inline notes, and treat sub-lists as notes?

Well that was it for this lovely monday.

## 2024-02-13 (putting the date somewhere in the heading is important)

Oh, and dates need to be formatted like `yyyy-mm-dd`.

* 0800 1100: ABC let's start with some ABC again
* 1100 1300: DEF
  * I'm getting tired of writing this example so let's stop here
